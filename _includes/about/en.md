Hello, I am **Pigeon**.

I am a student majoring in **Communication Engineering**.

I am passionate about the intersection of hardware and software, currently focusing on **Embedded Systems**.

Beyond embedded development, I also have a strong interest in **Exoskeleton Robots** and **Power Supply Technology**, and I am actively exploring these fields.

I believe technology can extend the boundaries of human capabilities. In this blog, I will document my learning path, project experiences, and thoughts on technology.

Glad to meet you here on the path of technology.
